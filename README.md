## Technologies: 

* HTML, I used the html to write the structure of my web page.
* CSS, I used the CSS to style my web page and give it some nice looking by adding colors.
* Javascript to add the funcuinality to the password generator.

## Editors:

* [Microsoft VS CODE:](  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ ) it’s an awesome code editor.
* [Nodepad++]( https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/ ) it’s very helpful code editor that am using all the time plus it’s very light weight.
